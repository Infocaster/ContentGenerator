Content Generator
</h1>

## Introduction
The content generator is a small tool that can help you to easily create any content item so you can quickly have some content to work with.
Right now the tool only supports randomized test content, but in the future might support more sophisticated generators.

## Getting started
You install the tool using NuGet into your Umbraco installation. Once installed, you don't need to configure anything. You can get started using the tool straight away.

1. Log in to the backoffice
2. Locate a parent content item in the content tree
3. Right click the three dots on the content item in the content tree
4. Select "Generate random content"
5. Select various options for your generated content and press "Submit"
6. Wait for the process to finish
7. Refresh your page to see your generated content.
