# Content Generator

## Introduction
The content generator is a small tool that can help you to easily create any content item so you can quickly have some content to work with.
Right now the tool only supports randomized test content, but in the future might support more sophisticated generators. This tool supports Umbraco 10 and Umbraco 13.

## Getting started
Install `Infocaster.Umbraco.ContentGenerator` from nuget using the following dotnet command:

```
dotnet add package Infocaster.Umbraco.ContentGenerator
```
